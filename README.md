We live in a world where the amount of data that we have available to us is growing exponentially. Our project utilizes one form of this ever-growing data: twitter tweets to help users make better and faster decisions by understanding the sentiment surrounding various stocks and financial items through a variety of resources.

Our user interface is meant to be simple yet enticing in appearance. The first thing that the user sees is a pop-up graphic that helps them understand the model and its simplicity. Once done with that, the user can input any stock/financial item and let our backend NLP model do the heavy crunching. 

Next come the results. Our model analyzes tweets about the financial topic and gives the user a percent breakdown of what the general sentiment of tweets is(positive, neutral, negative). Along with the numerical numbers, we present this to the user in easy-to-understand graphs. The website also gives the user an overall sentiment on the stock, helping inform their investing decisions. Additionally, to encourage transparency and exploration, the user can download a csv file with some of the tweets that we used, what our model classified it as, and how sure our model was! We think that this last part makes the project unique as giving the user the power to see the logic behind the modelâ€™s decision helps increase the scope of this project.

 We utilize the Roberta-Large model to make our predictions. The model based on a pre-trained model from the Transformers library that we further trained and refined on a financial tweets dataset from Kaggle. Overall, the model gives an average accuracy of 83% for each individual tweet, although the percentage for the accuracy of the overall tweets in a given topic is much higher due to the amount of tweets we analyze!
