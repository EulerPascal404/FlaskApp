@ToddDeringer That makes no sense. All the environmentally concerned and enlightened individuals I know plan to buy Tesla vehicles. I love my Model 3. I will buy another Tesla when I’m ready to trade that one in for a new vehicle. If there’s a stock split I’ll be buying Tesla stock.,neutral,0.4098014533519745
@HolmMartens @caslernoel @elonmusk Lol. Teslas are trash and now that better built  EVs are coming out they are doomed. The Twitter buyout was never gonna happen it was a ruse to dump Tesla stock before it plummeted. His actions since the announcement have proven he was never serious.,neutral,0.40626537799835205

@SolarWaterET @realnamskie @jamesjansson @elonmusk @fintwit_news @Twitter Exactly my point. He is playing with the stock market using his fanboys and investor money from tesla. Its not brave or smart to play with someone else's money. Its unethical. Its unbelievable that how many ppl think rich ppl r brave and brilliant for playing with other's money.,positive,0.47210389375686646
