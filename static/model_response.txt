"@richsignorelli @elonmusk @Tesla @SpaceX is now more relevant than NASA, @Tesla is the only legitimate E-car manuf. Starlink and The boring company are changing the world.  @elonmusk can change the stock market trajectory with a tweet, and your nickname will always be Dick.",positive,tensor(0.6539)
"I have no doubt if Tesla stock tanks and King Midas, aka @elonmusk loses billions, our tax code will somehow enable him to deduct it all and become richer.",negative,tensor(0.8627)
@ToddDeringer That makes no sense. All the environmentally concerned and enlightened individuals I know plan to buy Tesla vehicles. I love my Model 3. I will buy another Tesla when I’m ready to trade that one in for a new vehicle. If there’s a stock split I’ll be buying Tesla stock.,neutral,tensor(0.4098)
@HolmMartens @caslernoel @elonmusk Lol. Teslas are trash and now that better built  EVs are coming out they are doomed. The Twitter buyout was never gonna happen it was a ruse to dump Tesla stock before it plummeted. His actions since the announcement have proven he was never serious.,neutral,tensor(0.4063)

"So, I noticed Tesla charging stations have gone up in electric charging cost since Tesla stock dropped a few days ago. @elonmusk is doing EXACTLY what gas manufacturers are doing.",neutral,tensor(0.8198)
@SolarWaterET @realnamskie @jamesjansson @elonmusk @fintwit_news @Twitter Exactly my point. He is playing with the stock market using his fanboys and investor money from tesla. Its not brave or smart to play with someone else's money. Its unethical. Its unbelievable that how many ppl think rich ppl r brave and brilliant for playing with other's money.,positive,tensor(0.4721)
@KathrynTewson @FirearmsPB @TheDebbieMia @apark2453 Is this the same weirdo from yesterday who was so confused that he convinced himself Elon was directly swapping Tesla stock for Twitter stock? Despite the purchase agreement saying it was for money?,neutral,tensor(0.5448)
